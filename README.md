# Roboticlab3_Obj-detection_on_yolov8l
Robotic laboratory 3 project in second year KMITL

This file is aim to explain breifly about the whole project that we have done so far.

In this repository, we have conclude everything in one single file Robotics_lab_mini_project.ipynb files wihch we will seperate 
two cell and add our code in Python and executable in Google colab.

##########################################################

The first cell of the notebook will show about how we achieve training the model using Yolov8l model that is one of Yolov8 model 
that capable for training computer vision model

By contrbution of the Ultralytics team in Github, we can use Ultralytics as an opensource software. We can use pip Python 
package manager to install ultralytics


###########################################################

The second cell in the repository is to deploy the model using API key of my own Roboflow project into Jetson nano
This file is originally from Roboflow blog which I implement an using it to make a python file in Jetson nano.
However, due to the problem with Jetso nano library manager, I cannot run it with Python3.
